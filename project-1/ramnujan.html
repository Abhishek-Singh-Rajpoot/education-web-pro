    <section>
      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, a small town in Tamil Nadu, India. His parents were poor and Ramanujan's early life was marked by poverty and illness. Despite these challenges, Ramanujan showed a natural talent for mathematics from an early age. He spent much of his childhood reading mathematics books and developing his own mathematical theories.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
      <p>Ramanujan's lack of formal education in mathematics made it difficult for him to find work as a mathematician. However, he continued to study and develop his theories in his spare time. In 1909, Ramanujan published his first paper, which included a theorem on Bernoulli numbers. This paper caught the attention of several mathematicians, including G. H. Hardy, a professor at Cambridge University.</p>

      <h2>Collaboration with G.H. Hardy</h2>
      <p>In 1913, Ramanujan wrote to Hardy, who was already an established mathematician, seeking his advice on his mathematical theories. Hardy recognized the genius of Ramanujan's work and invited him to Cambridge. Ramanujan spent five years at Cambridge, collaborating with Hardy on several important mathematical papers. During this time, Ramanujan made several groundbreaking discoveries in number theory, including the famous Ramanujan prime and the Ramanujan theta function.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Later Life and Legacy</h2>
      <p>Ramanujan returned to India in 1919 and continued to develop his theories until his death in 1920 at the age of 32. His work has had a profound impact on modern mathematics, and many of his theorems and formulas are still used today. Ramanujan's life and work have been the subject of several books and films, including the critically acclaimed movie "The Man Who Knew Infinity."</p>
